# What is PwL ?



# PwL [[http://paperswelove.org/][Around the world]]


# The need for "Papers we love"

- data science is multi-disciplinary. "multiverse".
- validate your own actions -- {boundaries, wrong / right, do not reinvent square wheels}
- new ideas from academia and industry practitioners
- connect ideas to problems


*  Why PwL in data science?



*  What we can get out of such a thing?

- research -> practice
- practice -> publish / capture ideas


* Should we always go for the latest and greatest?


* Sources

- Conferences (which ones?)
- Journals (which?)
- By Topic
- By people / group / organisations (companies.. eg: goog, fb, for specialised interests)
-  **Survey papers**


* Outcomes of PwL

- Name a concept
- Explain the concept
- Explain how it works
- Explain how it is an improvement
- Where to use it. (Upside)
- Where not to use it. (Downside)

* The Paper for today's session
