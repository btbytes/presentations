# Presentation on Bayesian Learning by Pradeep Gowda

  * First of a multi-part series on Bayesian analysis
  * Covered some basic background and then focused in on a analysis of conditional inferences of positive cancer screenings.

## Presentation on Generalization by Sheamus Parkes

### Very Basic Notes:

  * Classic bias variance curve
    * Best algorithms let you walk the tradeoff
    * It's all just ridging
      * Random forest is a bit different 
  * Subtle overfitting sourcesâ€¦
    * Tuning one (or two) hyperparameters won't overfit... Tuning many algorithms and picking the best will overfit 
    * Not including feature selection as part of the tuning process
